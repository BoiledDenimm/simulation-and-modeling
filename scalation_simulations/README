To run:
	place the files inside of $SCALATION/src/main/scala/test
	test is a folder you have created

From $SCALATION, run:
	sbt compile
	./scar GroceryCheckout
	./scar AbleBakerCarHop
	./scar DumpTruck

In each file, change the variable nArrivals to alter the simulation length.
AbleBakerCarHop and DumpTruck both are based on distributions from Randi.
We weren't sure how Randi is seeded, aka if you can test against your own,
so we added in extra print statements to allow for the manual stepping through
each line to see that each event/activity was occuring correctly.

These simulations are based off of examples in the textbook Discrete-Event System Simulation 5/e
by Banks, Carson, Nelson and Nicol, 2010:

    Able-Baker Call Center: Example 3.1: Page 91

    Grocery Store Checkout Counter: Example 3.3: Page 98

    Dump Trucks for Hauling Coal: Example 3.5: Page 104
